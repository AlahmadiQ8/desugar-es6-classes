# Live Demo of es6 Classes vs Protorypes

*this demo is a participation in the [codepen challenge](https://codepen.io/challenges/2018/august/3) "Teach a Javascript Conecept"*

Classes were introduced in es6 offering easier oop style programming. 
They are however nothing more than a synctatic sugar over object prototypes and 
function constructors (actually, they [do a bit more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Boxing_with_prototype_and_static_methods)).

This codepen is a live demo that converts Class Syntax to traditional prototypes. 
Codeshift function desugarClasses is available on github.
